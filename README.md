# FPE-App

In cryptography, format-preserving encryption (FPE), refers to encrypting in such a way that the output the ciphertext is in the same format as the input plaintext. The meaning of "format" varies. Typically only finite domains are discussed, for example:

To encrypt a 16-digit credit card number so that the ciphertext is another 16-digit number.
To encrypt an English word so that the ciphertext is another English word.
To encrypt an n-bit number so that the ciphertext is another n-bit number (this is the definition of an n-bit block cipher).

This App is starting test for this algorithm using  Key management and access control techniques, which we are applying this process in client-side same goes to decryption process. 

Case Study: 

1- Calculating time where we are receiving plain data from IoT Device.
2- Encrypting that data after receiving with calculating the encryption time.
3- Sending an encrypting data with the same size as the plaintext to a remote cloud.
